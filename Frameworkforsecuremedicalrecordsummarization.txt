A framework for secure medical record summarising is a system designed to extract essential details from medical records yet preserve data privacy and security. The design comprises numerous stages towards effectively and securely collecting medical records. The first step is data anonymization, which includes eliminating or encrypting personally identifiable information in order to protect patient privacy. This step is critical for adhering to data protection rules yet preserving patient confidentiality. The data needed from the medical records can be obtained using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. NLP algorithms scan the text for important details like diagnoses, treatments, medications, and test outcomes.

The framework uses encryption techniques for protecting the summarised medical records during storage and transfer to maintain data security. Encryption prevents people who are not authorized from accessing the sensitive information contained in the records. Data access control is an additional characteristic of the system. It entails putting in place strong access restrictions and user authentication systems to ensure that only authorized people, such as healthcare providers and researchers, have access to the condensed medical records. Furthermore, the architecture incorporates data integrity and auditing ways. It ensures that the aggregated records are up-to-date and full and that any alterations or data entries have been recorded and transparent.

As a whole, the design for secure medical record summarization connects data anonymization, machine learning, encryption, access control, and auditing to make it possible for the efficient and secure extraction of essential information from medical records. This framework supports the usage of condensed medical records for research, healthcare planning, and decision-making by safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring data security while complying to legal and moral limits.
