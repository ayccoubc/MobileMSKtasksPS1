Python is a multi-purpose programming language that can be used for machine learning, AI, and Web development. Python program can be downloaded and installed through the Python.org website. A code editor is required to write, edit and execute the code. It can be downloaded and installed from Jetbrains.com. 
Create a new project in the Code Editor. 

print("text") - a function that displays text messages on our application window. 

The terminal window shows the output of our code after running the python file.
A Python program is executed from top to bottom. 

Variable - assigning a number, characters, or boolean value(False or True) to a word or multiple words. Multiple words should be separated by an underscore.  For example, age = 20, price = 19.95, first_name = "Avnish",  online = False, offline = True. To Print variable age, print(age). 
If same variable is used for something new, its old value will be replaced by new. 

Python is case-sensitive.

Input - input("text") - to get input from user after running the code. 
String concatenation - adding two strings - example, print("Hello" + Name). The Variable "Name" must be a string. print("Sum is" + str(Sum)).  

Type conversion - convert string to integer and vice versa. Ex, int(input(" ")) - String input is converted to an integer. Also, we can use float(), bool(), str() in place of int(). 

Strings - indexing begins from 0 and from left to right.
After assigning a string to a variable, say name = "Thomas Shelby", several functions can be performed by adding a dot, name. , and then choosing functions from Dropbox. The original string and variable are unaffected. 
'in' operator -  to check whether a group of characters is present in strings.Output is Boolean. Ex, print("mas" in name). o/p is True. 

Arithmetic Operators - +,-,*,/. Modulus op - % - gives the remainder of a division. Exponent(**) - 10**3 - 1000. // - gives the integral part of a division as output.
x = 10, x += 3 -- new x = 13. 

Operator precedence -- BODMAS rule. 

Comparison Operators - >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=. O/p is True or False. 

Logical Operators - and, or, not. O/p is True or False.

Comments start with "#"

If statements - if,elif,else
temp=35
if temp>30:
    print("It's a hot day")
    print("Drink water")
elif temp>20: # (20,30]
    print("It's a nice day")

While loop - ex, 
i=1
while i<=5:
    print(i)
    i=i+1

Lists - names = ["John", "Bob", "Mosh", "Sam", "Mary"], numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
To know the number of objects in a list, print(len(name of the list))

For loop - ex,
 numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
 for item in numbers:
     print(item)

Range Function - to generate a sequence of numbers.
numbers = range(5) # range is assumed[0,5)
numbers = range(5,10) # it means [5,10)
numbers = range(5, 10, 2) # 2 acts as a step

Tuples - Like lists, but can't be changed once created. Numbers = (1,2,3,3,4,5,5,2,1,1,7).
