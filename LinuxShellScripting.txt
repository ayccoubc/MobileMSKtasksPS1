Linux shell scripting is the process of creating and executing scripts in a shell language, such as Bash, to automate tasks or carry out complex tasks on a Linux system.

Shell is an operating system command-line interface which enables users to communicate with it.  

Variables are utilized by shell scripts to store data. They can store numbers, texts, or various types of info. Without specifying their type, variables are established and the "=" operator is what's used to assign values to these.

Comments are used to give explanations or notes. # 

Execution of commands - Shell scripts may execute programs, scripts, and system commands by simply writing the command on a new line. The command's output can be stored and stored in variables for additional analysis.

Shell scripts - utilize control structures like conditional statements (if-else, case) and loops (for, while) to repeatedly process a set of data or manage the flow of execution based on conditions.

Functions -  enable modularity and reusability by enabling us to group a group of commands together. They may take input parameters and generate outcomes.

Input and output -  Shell scripts can read from files with the "read" command or by redirecting input from a file. They can also accept input from people. The "echo" command can be used to display output on the screen or direct it to a file.

Shell scripts have the ability to create, read, write, and alter files and directories by applying commands like "mkdir," "cp," "mv,"
In shell scripting, error handling is crucial. Conditional statements and exit codes are tools for error checking and handling.

Execution of scripts -  In order to run a shell script, make it executable using the "chmod" command.
